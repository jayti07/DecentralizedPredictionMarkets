# Decentralized Prediction Market

## Project Description

The **Decentralized Prediction Market** is a platform built on the Aptos blockchain that allows users to bet on the outcomes of real-world events using cryptocurrency. The platform facilitates transparent, decentralized betting where users can create prediction markets for various events and place bets on different outcomes. The goal is to provide a fair and accessible betting system that leverages the power of blockchain for transparency and security.

## Project Vision

The vision of the Decentralized Prediction Market is to enable a decentralized ecosystem where individuals can participate in prediction markets without relying on traditional intermediaries. The platform aims to be an easy-to-use, secure, and transparent solution for betting on real-world events while using blockchain technology to ensure fairness and trustworthiness. This will empower users globally to take part in an open betting system that eliminates centralized control and biases.

## Future Scope

1. **Event Resolution**: Adding functionality to resolve the events after they occur and distribute winnings to users based on the outcomes.
2. **Multiple Outcomes**: Expanding the contract to support more than two outcomes for each event, allowing more complex prediction markets.
3. **Decentralized Oracles**: Integrating decentralized oracles for real-world data fetching, enabling more diverse event types.
4. **Automated Payouts**: Implementing an automated payout mechanism to distribute earnings to the winning users once an event is concluded.
5. **Governance**: Adding a governance token or DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) to let users vote on event rules, market management, and future features.

## Key Features

- **Create Prediction Markets**: Users can create new prediction markets for real-world events by specifying the event name.
- **Place Bets on Outcomes**: Bettors can place their bets on one of the two possible outcomes of the event.
- **Blockchain-based Transactions**: All transactions are handled securely using the Aptos blockchain and AptosCoin for transparent bet handling.
- **Event Outcomes**: Currently, the contract supports two possible outcomes for each event (outcome 1 or outcome 2).
- **Transparency & Security**: The decentralized nature of the platform ensures no central authority controls the betting, providing a secure environment for users.
